## General

This will be a six week session on working through the problem of discerning God's Will for us. The style will be that of a short lecture on a specific theme from scripture and other holy writing as it deals with helping us solve this problem followed by a discussion. the study ends with the same small group individual prayers.

As decided at State of the Study V this will be an in-person bible study. In accordance with general hygenic protocols I will host the bible study in my backyard and use a projector & laptop to integrate those who wish to participate over zoom.

It is important to contemplate the topic for the week and try to apply some of the insights in your prayer life so you can find what difficulties you are having in discernment as you are probably not the only one facing the same challenge. With the shared experience we can deepen our understanding of the Word.

The Structure of the Bible Study for the next six weeks is as follows:

1. Opening Prayer
2. Discussion of Topic from last week and general meditations that have happened in the past 7 days
3. Lecture by Bible Study Leader on the current focus 
4. Group Discussion
5. Small Group Prayers
6. Closing Prayer

## Notes

### Discernment

- You were made to Glorify God
- Discernment is the process of aligning your will with God's Will
- Settling into Silence with God will help train your perceptions towards his Calling.
- You may not be able to reach Perfection but you are called to be a Saint so you should try.
- It is important to consult with God from your daily decisions all the way to choosing your vocation.

### OODA Loop

- The Observe/Orient/Decide/Act loop as developed by John Boyd is an excellent way of finding out at which point in your decision making process you should consult with God.

### Zoom Implementation

The Bible Study Host will endeavor to get a microphone situation working on the computer so that the phone solution does not need to be used.


## Scripture
### 1 Peter 3:17
> 3:17  For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer, than doing ill.
### Matthew 5:41-48
> [41] And whosoever will force thee one mile, go with him other two, [42] Give to him that asketh of thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not away. [43] You have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thy enemy. [44] But I say to you, Love your enemies: do good to them that hate you: and pray for them that persecute and calumniate you: [45] That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven, who maketh his sun to rise upon the good, and bad, and raineth upon the just and the unjust. [46] For if you love them that love you, what reward shall you have? do not even the publicans this? [47] And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more? do not also the heathens this? [48] Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect.
### Matthew 13:9
> And he said: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
### Romans Chapter 12
> 12:1-2 [1] I BESEECH you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing unto God, your reasonable service. [2] And be not conformed to this world; but be reformed in the newness of your mind, that you may prove what is the good, and the acceptable, and the perfect will of God.
### Ephesians Chapter 4 
> 4:26-30 [26] Be angry, and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your anger. [27] Give not place to the devil. [28] He that stole, let him now steal no more; but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need. [29] Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth; but that which is good, to the edification of faith, that it may administer grace to the hearers. [30] And grieve not the holy Spirit of God: whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption.
