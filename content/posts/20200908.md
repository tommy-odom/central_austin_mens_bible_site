## Scripture

### Genesis 1:27
> [27] And God created man to his own image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them.
### John 17:6-10
> [6] I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they were, and to me thou gavest them; and they have kept thy word. [7] Now they have known, that all things which thou hast given me, are from thee: [8] Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to them; and they have received them, and have known in very deed that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. [9] I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine: [10] And all my things are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.
### Ephesians 4:24
> [22] To put off, according to former conversation, the old man, who is corrupted according to the desire of error. [23] And be renewed in the spirit of your mind: [24] And put on the new man, who according to God is created in justice and holiness of truth. [25] Wherefore putting away lying, speak ye the truth every man with his neighbour; for we are members one of another.
### Ephesians 5:1-2
> [1] Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children; [2] And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness. 
### Titus 2:6-16
> [6] Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober. [7] In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in doctrine, in integrity, in gravity, [8] The sound word that can not be blamed: that he, who is on the contrary part, may be afraid, having no evil to say of us. [9] Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters, in all things pleasing, not gainsaying: [10] Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things:

> [11] For the grace of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men; [12] Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and justly, and godly in this world, [13] Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, [14] Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works. [15] These things speak, and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
### Psalms 36:3-5,23-24
> 36:3-5  [3] Trust in the Lord, and do good, and dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed with its riches. [4] Delight in the Lord, and he will give thee the requests of thy heart. [5] Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, and he will do it.
36:23-24  With the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed, and he shall like well his way. [24] When he shall fall he shall not be bruised, for the Lord putteth his hand under him. 
### Luke 10:26-28
> [26] But he said to him: What is written in the law? how readest thou? [27] He answering, said: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind: and thy neighbour as thyself. [28] And he said to him: Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.
