## Fr.Daniel's Discussion

Primarily this was using St.Thomas' Summa Theologia (at least a summary) in regrads to the different kinds of fears. Fear is itself a stage in a process and that grasping the fear is what can lead to sin. You can be afraid in Heaven. Lots of discussion of personal experiences with fear and how to overcome it when turning to the lord and your brothers.

Thanks again to Fr.Daniel for putting this on and it was very instructive and interesting.
