# Bible Study Leadership Queue

Each Bible Study is a 3 - 6 week session hosted by a study leader. This is the current queue of volunteers. Operates on a 'first come first served' basis but timing can be adjusted as needed. Contact the study coordinator (currently D.H.) to get your name on the list or to make adjustments to your position.
