<h3 id="the-study">The Study</h3>
<p>The in-person bible study is a weekly meet-up on Tuesdays between 8pm and 10pm. After an introductory prayer there is a predetermined topic, usually based on study of Sacred Scripture, which is discussed for 60 minutes with the whole group and then groups of 3-4 split off to discuss their current circumstances and ask for prayer with the study ending in a group prayer. The sessions are based about rotations of 3-6 weeks where a bible study leader determines the location and topic and hosts the study. There is usually a one week break between rotations. An elected coordinator works with volunteers to best facilitate change over between rotations. As it stands now whenever there is any challenge presented to the group a State of the Study is called in order to discuss and vote on the matter.</p>
<h3 id="groupme">GroupMe</h3>
<p>The primary means of communication is over the group text appplication <em>GroupMe</em> where access to the group is granted by a current member after they have met the prospective member. Polls on topics, information regarding the location and topic of the next bible study is distributed, and sometimes recreational/charitable opprotunities are shared with the group.</p>
<h3 id="website">Website</h3>
<p>The website is used as another way of communicating the topic of the study along with notes related to the discussion (without sharing the details on location). There is a section that presents a list of topics both past and future for prospective volunteers to contemplate as they decide what they want their rotation to be on. The coordinator has a page for listing the current queue of volunteers so that people can see who else is in line and what sort of topics are in the pipeline. A page on quality resources is provided as well.</p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>Until a mechanism can be implemented that protects personal information this website will not display any identifying information as it is easily accessible. Initials are used instead of full names to denote who the bible leader of the session is.</p>
